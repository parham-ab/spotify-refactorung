## 🚀 Features

React Spotify Clone provides a complete music player experience:

### ⏱ Progress Scrubber

Seek to any point in a song using a draggable progress bar with live current/total time display.

### ⏭ Track Navigation

Skip to the next or previous song with queue wrapping — the last track loops back to the first.

Like and unlike any song. All liked tracks are collected on a dedicated Favorites page.

### 🔔 Toast Notifications

Instant visual feedback via react-hot-toast whenever a song is added or removed from favorites.

### 📱 Responsive Layout

## 🗂 State Management

Global state is handled by a single **Zustand** store (`src/store/spotifyStore.js`):

- `songData` — array of all tracks with `active`, `isPlaying`, and `isFavorite` flags
- `songTrack` — the raw `<audio>` DOM node registered by `AudioProvider` on mount
- `playHandle(id)` — toggles play/pause for the active song, or loads and plays a new one
- `nextSongHandle / prevSongHandle` — advances or rewinds the queue with wrapping
- `toggleFavorite(id)` — flips `isFavorite` and fires a toast notification
- `getCurrentSong()` — derives the active song live from `songData` (no stale snapshot)

The `<audio>` element lives in `AudioProvider` and is registered via `setSongTrack`, making it available to all store actions without prop-drilling or React context.

## 🌐 Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on **Netlify**. The `public/_redirects` file ensures React Router's client-side routing works correctly on page refresh:

```
/*  /index.html  200
```
